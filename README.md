# myToolJava
This repository is a Java tool collection coming from my daily work
1.CodeReencoding.java
	A java program to transcode from GBK to UTF-8.If you use eclipse's default encoding scheme GBK and you have added many annotation, 
	you could run this program to transcode instead of manual operation.
2.FileOperationTool.java
	This program provides a lot of file operation, including for example file copy, file name getting etc.This java file would be added other functions in the future.
